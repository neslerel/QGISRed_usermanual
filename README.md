QGISRed is a tool to help the hydraulic engineer in the task of modelling a water distribution network and in the decision-making process, within the environment of a Geographic Information System (GIS). This tool is designed as a plugin to the free software QGis. However, QGISRed uses the source code of the GISRed software, an application designed as a desktop tool for the Windows operating system.&#x20;

The QGISRed plugin is developed with the objective of being able to take advantage of all the tools that a GIS environment can provide in a native way. For example, geo-processing tools, use of satellite images, style management, etc. On the contrary, this plugin will have some limitations against the potential that may include the GISRed tool.
